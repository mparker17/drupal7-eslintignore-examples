# drupal7-eslintignore-examples

Some eslintignore samples for Drupal 7 projects.

Since Drupal's coding standards differ slightly from other communities, [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) needs a `.eslintrc` file (and usually, a `.eslintignore` file as well) in your project's root directory. 

If you're working on a Drupal 8 project, ESLint will just work, because it's configuration files ship with Drupal 8.0.x core. For other projects, you'll need to [copy `.eslintrc` from Drupal 8 core](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/tree/.eslintrc).

[Drupal 8.0.x core's `.eslintignore`](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/tree/.eslintignore) probably won't work for your project, but this project is designed to provide some example ones that will.

If you need to customize these `.eslintignore` files further, refer to [the official `.eslintignore` documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#ignoring-files-and-directories).
